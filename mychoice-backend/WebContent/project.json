  "nameProject": "VITAMIN",
  "description": "The VITAMIN project (VegetarIan Transition Argument ModellINg) aims to get a better understanding of factors influencing individuals in their transition to reduce their animal product consumption. We use comprehensive individual interviews, questionnaires as well as diverse modelling techniques (mainly SMA & argumentation systems) to collect and analyse this topic. Our final intent is to develop an agent-based model integrating individuals' argumentation networks about vegetarian transitions.
