        "explanation": "Biologically, oysters are not in the plant kingdom, but when it comes to ethical eating, they are almost indistinguishable from plants. Oyster farms account for 95 percent of all oyster consumption and have a minimal negative impact on their ecosystems; there are even nonprofit projects devoted to cultivating oysters as a way to improve water quality. Since so many oysters are farmed, there's little danger of overfishing. No forests are cleared for oysters, no fertilizer is needed, and no grain goes to waste to feed them—they have a diet of plankton, which is about as close to the bottom of the food chain as you can get. Oyster cultivation also avoids many of the negative side effects of plant agriculture: There are no bees needed to pollinate oysters, no pesticides required to kill off other insects, and for the most part, oyster farms operate without the collateral damage of accidentally killing other animals during harvesting",

Il a pour objectif de comprendre la possible émergence d’une seconde transition alimentaire. Le projet est centré sur une approche de modélisation. Il étudie les décisions alimentaires à long terme et s’appuie sur la construction d’un modèle combinant systèmes d’argumentation et simulation multi-agent pour modéliser les décisions des individus d’une population en fonction de différents facteurs (valeurs individuelles, influence du réseau social, de crises, de communications, etc.).",
